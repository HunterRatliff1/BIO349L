# require(googlesheets)

require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)

require(ggplot2)
require(ggthemes)
require(scales)
```

First, we'll read the data from the [Google Sheet](https://goo.gl/DKtQGy) from 
where it is hosted. We'll save the data as `2015.csv` and `2016.csv` in a `Data/` 
sub-directory:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gs_title("Module3") %>% 
  gs_read_csv("2015") %>%
  group_by(Time, MolarityNaF) %>% 
  mutate(Total = Arms0 + Arms1 + Arms2) %>% 
  export("Data/2015.csv")

gs_title("Module3") %>% 
  gs_read_csv("2016") %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Time) %>% 
  mutate(Total = Arms0 + Arms1 + Arms2) %>% 
  export("Data/2016.csv")
```

Then, we read the data in as a data.frame:

```{r}
df_15 <- import("Data/2015.csv") %>% tbl_df()
df_16 <- import("Data/2016.csv") %>% tbl_df()
```

# Variables

## Dependnet Varaibles

These datasets contains `r comma(sum(df_16$Total))` observations from 2016 and 
`r comma(sum(df_15$Total))` observations from 2015.

These datasets focus on the development of sea urchin embryos that were exposed to 
sodium fluoride (NaF) during development. In the 2015 set, both the concentration 
of NaF and the duration of exposure were varied. The total number of observations 
for both these variables can been seen in the table output below:

```{r Totals_2015, echo=F}
df_15 %>% 
  rename(NaF=MolarityNaF) %>%
  group_by(Time, NaF) %>% 
  summarise(Total = sum(Total, na.rm = T)) %>%
  spread(Time, Total)
```

In the 2016 set, the concentration of NaF was further simplified to a binary 
variable (either `control` or `NaF`), and more nuanced time intervals were examined. 
These time intervals are illustrated in the plot below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
df_16 %>% 
  mutate(Time = stringr::str_replace(Time, pattern=" h", replacement="")) %>%
  separate(col=Time, into=c("Start", "End"), sep="-", convert=T) %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Start, End) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(Total, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Total)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=Start, ymax=End), color="red") + 
  labs(y="Time Exposed (hours)", x="Number Exposed", 
       title="Duration Exposed to NaF (2016)") +
  coord_flip() + theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(axis.title=element_text())
```

Note: <em>Because the control embryos weren't exposed, and thus had no interval of 
exposure, they've been omitted from the above plot (n=
`r comma(sum(df_16$Total[df_16$Treatment=="Control"]))`).</em>

## Independnet Varaibles

The variable being observed in both these datasets is the number of "arms" that 
developed. Under normal developmental circumstances embryos develop two arms, but 
exposure to NaF is believed to reduce the number of arms that develop. 

For each group, the number of embryos with 0, 1, and 2 arms were counted and the 
total recorded. 

# Results

## Results: Concentration of NaF

```{r}
Plot1 <- import("Data/2015.csv") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Arms2/Total, fill=factor(MolarityNaF), 
             color=factor(MolarityNaF))) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.5) + 
  labs(x="Had Two Arms") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(name="Molarity of NaF", palette = 4) +
  scale_color_brewer(name="Molarity of NaF", palette = 2, type = "qual") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent) + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.title=element_text())
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5.5}
Plot1 + labs(title="Concentration of NaF (2015)")
```

Above is a density plot illustrating the percentage of embryos who developed both 
arms, with each density curve colored by the concentration of NaF embryos were 
exposed to during development. It's evidently clear that no exposure to NaF
(the lightest blue) has a severe rightward skew. This skew indicates that the
vast majority of embryos in the control group developed normally. 

Unsurprisingly, the embryos exposed to NaF had a leftward skew, indicating a good 
number of embryos didn't develop to have two arms. More importantly, it appears 
that both levels of NaF exposure (2 mM and 4 mM) have similar density distributions.
This indicates that the level of exposure isn't nearly as important as wither or 
not embryos are exposed in the first place. 

This same observation can be seen if we examine the within-group distribution for 
each NaF concentration. The bar plot below shows the relative percentage of embryos 
with 0, 1, or 2 arms for each treatment group. The percentages are nearly identical 
for both concentrations, but show a marked difference from the control group 
(represented by 0 mols/L of NaF).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
df_15 %>% 
  group_by(NaF=MolarityNaF, Treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    Total = sum(Total),
    Arms0 = sum(Arms0)/Total,
    Arms1 = sum(Arms1)/Total,
    Arms2 = sum(Arms2)/Total) %>%
  gather(Arms, Percent, Arms0:Arms2) %>%
  mutate(Arms = stringr::str_replace(Arms, "Arms", "")) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(NaF), y=Percent, fill=factor(Arms))) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(name="# of Arms", type="qual", palette=3) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.title=element_text()) +
  labs(x="NaF [mols/L]", y="Percent of Total",
       title="Number of Arms by NaF Concentration", 
       subtitle="(Voke, 2015)")
```

```{r}
df_15 %>% 
  group_by(NaF=MolarityNaF, Treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    Total = sum(Total),
    Arms0 = sum(Arms0)/Total,
    Arms1 = sum(Arms1)/Total,
    Arms2 = sum(Arms2)/Total) %>%
  gather(Arms, Percent, Arms0:Arms2) %>%
  mutate(
    Arms = stringr::str_replace(Arms, "Arms", ""),
    Arms = paste(Arms, "Arms"),
    Percent = percent(Percent)) %>%
  spread(Arms, Percent) %>%
  select(-Treatment, -Total) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Results: Onset & Duration of Exposure

Given that the concentration of NaF doesn't seem to be that important, the next 
logical question becomes about the timing of exposure. To explore this in more
detail, we'll take the same density plot that we discussed above, and facet it by
each time interval of exposure:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
Plot1 + facet_wrap("Time") + 
  labs(title="Concentration of NaF (2015)",
       subtitle="Facet by Time of Exposure")
```

This illustrates the effects of early exposure in determining the number of arms 
that eventually form. In the top two facets (`2-24 h` and `2-48 h`) show a marked 
decrease in the percentage of normal embryos that develop, as indicated by the 
leftward skew. On the other hand, embryos that were exposed after `24 h` or not
exposed at all (i.e. the `NA` facet) display a rightward skew. 

From this we can conclude that early exposure is a key component in disrupting arm
development. Likewise, we see that these new density distributions hold true to 
our findings regarding the insignificance of the concentration of NaF.

Again, this can also be illustrated using bar plots:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
df_15 %>% 
  group_by(Time, Treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    Total = sum(Total),
    Arms0 = sum(Arms0)/Total,
    Arms1 = sum(Arms1)/Total,
    Arms2 = sum(Arms2)/Total) %>%
  gather(Arms, Percent, Arms0:Arms2) %>%
  mutate(Arms = stringr::str_replace(Arms, "Arms", "")) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x=Time, y=Percent, fill=factor(Arms))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black") + 
  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(name="# of Arms", type="qual", palette=4) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.title=element_text()) +
  labs(x="Time treated with NaF", y="Percent of Total",
       title="Arms by Time Exposed (2015)")
```

Next, we'll take a look at the 2016 data. As mentioned above, this dataset takes
a deeper look into the timing of exposure in the first 24 hours of development.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
df_16 %>%
  replace_na(list(Time="Control")) %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Time) %>%
  summarise(
    Total = sum(Total),
    Arms0 = sum(Arms0)/Total,
    Arms1 = sum(Arms1)/Total,
    Arms2 = sum(Arms2)/Total
  ) %>%
  gather(Arms, Percent, Arms0:Arms2) %>% 
  mutate(Arms = stringr::str_replace(Arms, "Arms", "")) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x=Time, y=Percent, fill=Arms)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black") +
  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(name="# of Arms", type="qual", palette=4) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + theme(axis.title=element_text()) +
  labs(x="Time treated with NaF", y="Percent of Total",
       title="Arms by Time Exposed (2016)")
  # facet_grid(.~Treatment, scales = "free_x")
  # ggplot(aes(x=Arms2, ))
```
